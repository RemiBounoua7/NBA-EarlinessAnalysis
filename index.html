        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The NBA regular season is ver very long. 82 games between October to April sometimes feel like an eternity.
            As a basketball enjoyer, how are you supposed to know how much trust you can put to this or that part of the season ?
            How many times did you ask yourselves if the good form your team displayed would last ? 
            If it was too late in the season to hope for a late playoff push ? <br><b>When is it not 'too early to tell' anymore ?</b> 
            And consequentially, <b>when is it really to late to hope ?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            We'll look at  <a href="https://remibounoua7.github.io/NBA-Championship-Corner/">1997-2024 NBA seasons' contenders</a> to see when the full picture emerged.
            If you aren't familiar with the 'contender zone' concept, developped in the aforementioned page, I suggest you take a look and come back here after.
        </p>
        <p>
            The methodology was the following :<br>
            - Take the 1997 to 2024 seasons <br>
            - Identify the final contenders : who were the teams that found themselves in the contender zone by the end of each season<br>
            - For every 2 weeks in the season, identify which team were in the zone at that time.<br>
            - Find the false positives and false negatives (more on that later)<br>
            - Average it out for the 27 years selected to get an idea of the general trends <br>

        <h2>False Positives & False Negatives</h2>
        <p>
            <u>False Positives</u> are teams that find themselves in the contender zone during the season, that don't last until the end.<br><br>
            They can have a good start, or a bad ending. They can have unfortunate injuries, bad luck or a simple dip in performances.
            What matters is that they don't last in the golden zone.
            <br><br>
            What we want to extract from the average false positive number per week is to know whether we can trust a team's good early season performances.
            Are they a serious contender ? How long until we can safely assume such label ? Are they subject to a fall ? <br><br>
            How many teams are in that position every year ? At what point in the season is it still a possibility ?
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <u>False Negatives</u> are teams that we know are contenders by the end of the season, that aren't there yet by the time we measure it.<br><br>
            For example, if a team reached contender status by Christmas (week 8), and stay there until the end of the season, they will be categorized as false negatives from week 2 to 6.
            Such teams can have a bad start, or find their true form during the season. They can have players coming back from injury, better shooting splits, a new coach, or make the one trade at the deadline that changes everything.
            What matters is that they weren't in the golden zone at some point but got there eventually.
            <br><br>
            What we want to get from the average false negative number per week is to know how much team we can suspect find their cruising speed late into the season.
            Who's a probable sleeper ? Who's the one team that's gonna come in from the play-in and upset the better seeds ? Is it too late for your team to be a real contender ?
            Can they salvage their season by firing their coach ?<br><br>
            How many teams are in that position every year ? At what point in the season is it still a possibility ?

            <p style="padding-left: 20px;">
                Here is the final graph, showing the average false positives and false negatives per week.

                For added context : 
                <br>- Start of the season : October (Week 0)
                <br>- Christmas : Week 10
                <br>- MLK Day : Week 14
                <br>- Trade Deadline : Week 16
                <br>- All Star Week-end : Week 18
                <br>- End of the season : Week 24-25
                
            </p> 
        </div>
        <p><br>
            SO, what can we conclude ?<br><br>First, we see more false positives than false negatives, meaning it's more likely for a team to become contender than for a team to fall out of the contender zone.
            Furthermore, after only 4 weeks, we can assume the teams we find in the contender zone are for the most part staying there ! <br>
            For the false negatives, this is much harder to analyze. There can be new contenders all the way to the end, we can assume at least 1 team gets in 3 weeks.

        <h2>What does it say about 2025 then ?</h2>
        <div class="text-image-container" style="padding-top: 30px;">
            <img style="width: 40%;"src="2025 screenshot with background.PNG">

            <p style="padding-left: 20px;">
            At the time of righting, we're just before Christmas. The picture looks like this : 7 contenders, with OKC Boston and Cleveland looking to be slight favorites and 4 western underdogs.
            But everything can change rapidly. <br><br>

            From what we saw, around Week 8-10 we can still expect 1 team to fall out, and 3 or 4 to enter the race.<br><br>
            <b>Meaning we can only get 3 or 4 of NY, Minnesota, Milwaukee, Denver, LA, Indiana, Philadelphia or Orlando to make it. Who are your picks ?</b>
            <br><b>And 1 actual contenders is likely to fall. Are the Rockets too good to be true ? Who has the toughest schedule left to play ? </b>
